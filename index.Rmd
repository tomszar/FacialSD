This is the main page of the facial sexual dimorphism analysis.
The links below will take you to the proper analysis.
Each link is in sequential order, many of them building on the output from the previous scripts.

- Here you can see some [descriptive statistics](Code/2017-07-DescriptiveStats.html) from the covariates and Face PCA.
- Here is the [hypothesis testing](Code/2017-07-HTesting.html) on the effect of sex and height on the face, using the whole dataset.
This is also the preliminary analysis on the allometric and non-allometric decomposition.
- Here you can visualize interactively some preliminary [face effects](Code/2017-07-FaceEffects.html) of sexual dimorphism mande in the previous script. 
Remember to open this file in chrome.
- Here you can see the clustering of the [genetic PCA](Code/2017-07-GenAnalysis.html). 
*Note:** the genetic PCA was made in plink, using only the HapMap individuals to create the PCA, and then projecting our samples.
- This is the core of the analysis, on the [population comparisons](Code/2017-08-PopComparison.html).
