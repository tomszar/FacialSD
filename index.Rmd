title: Evolution of Human Facial Sexual Dimorphism

---

## Summary

This project aims to test for differences in patterns of facial sexual dimorphism across populations.
The workflow can be summarized as follows:

- Obtain the 3D landmark data from participants' faces and run a standard geometric morphometrics approach, that involves generalized procrustes analysis, PCA, and retention of PCs that explain 90% of the variance.
- Decompose facial sexual dimorphism (FSD) in allometric and non-allometric components.
- Generate different groupings based on ancestry analysis from DNA.
- Compare pattern of FSD between populations.

The links below will take you to the proper analysis.
Each link is in sequential order, many of them building on the output from the previous scripts.

- Here you can see the generation of the [Face PCA](Code/2017-11-FacePCA.html). 
- Here you can see some [descriptive statistics](Code/2017-07-DescriptiveStats.html) from the covariates and Face PCA.
- Here is the [hypothesis testing](Code/2017-07-HTesting.html) on the effect of sex and height on the face, using the whole dataset.
This is also the preliminary analysis on the allometric and non-allometric decomposition.
- Here you can visualize interactively some preliminary [face effects](Code/2017-07-FaceEffects.html) of sexual dimorphism mande in the previous script. 
Remember to open this file in chrome.
- Here you can see the clustering of the [genetic PCA](Code/2017-07-GenAnalysis.html). 
**Note:** the genetic PCA was made in plink, using only the HapMap individuals to create the PCA, and then projecting our samples.
- This is the core of the analysis, on the [population comparisons](Code/2017-08-PopComparison.html). 
- Here you can see [FSD across human populations](Code/2018-03-FacePopEffects.html)
